								<h2 class="card-title">DO I NEED A WEBSITE FOR MY BUSINESS?</h2>
								<p class="card-text">You may not think that having a website will have much of an impact on your specific business, 
									even though you are aware of the necessity to have some sort of online presence, especially if you are currently making money.
									How do you feel? Does operating a successful business require having a website? 
									</p>
									<h6>This article explains the benefits of having a company website as well as the instances when one is not necessary.</h6>
									<div id="blog-readmore">
										<p >Many business owners contemplate the question, "Do I need a website since I have a small firm with few workers and since we don't sell anything online?"<br>
											The response is YES! <br>
											In order to compete with businesses that already have websites, you should have one if you own a business.
											Additionally, are you certain that you cannot sell your goods online? With millions of customers searching online for anything from books to clips to homes, natural gas, and more, COVID-19 has changed the retail environment. 
											Therefore, while you hesitate, your rival has probably already realized the value of a website for their company. 
											Without a doubt, you don't want to fall behind. 
											</p>
										<div id="blog-more" style="display: none;">
										  <p>Some may argue that they don't actually need a website because they have a Facebook page where they advertise all of their goods and services.

											If I Have a Facebook Page, Do I Still Need a Website? 
											
											Businesses frequently use Facebook or other social media sites as their primary platform for advertising. Additionally, these platforms have benefits. 
											
											
											For instance, they assist in audience growth and even assist in market research. A Facebook page for your company shouldn't take the role of your website. Here are a few explanations why you should have a functional website.
											<ol class="bloglist">
												<li><h4>Your Facebook page is not yours to own</h4> 
													What would you do if Facebook decided to stop supporting businesses? All of your clients and followers would undoubtedly go if your Facebook page was your only internet presence.
													In fact, quite recently, there were brief periods of chaos when Facebook was down everywhere. 
													Facebook may continue to assist companies, but you have no control over the adjustments Facebook decides to make. 
													On the other hand, you have complete control over the design and functionality of your website.
												</li>

												<li><h4>Facebook has SEO Restrictions</h4>
													Consider this: Where do you seek to find a local business? Google or Facebook? Google's 3.5 billion daily searches 
													demonstrate that most individuals prefer search engines over social networks when looking for information. 
													You may place yourself on a company website so that people will find you when they conduct searches for the goods 
													or services you offer. Even if you have no trouble competing with bigger websites, you can still get visitors from your 
													neighbourhood by optimizing your website for local searches.
												</li>
												<li><h4>Websites have greater credibility </h4>
													People only make purchases from companies they know, like, and trust, thus a company website is a mark of trust in 
													itself. Therefore, even if it could be simpler to develop a Facebook profile, a company website would give you 
													more authority and confidence. 

												</li>

												<li><h4>Facebook's attention span is short</h4>
													Facebook is incredibly competitive. If your company is posted on Facebook, you must continually contend with competition from several other businesses. <br>

													Furthermore, you must outperform the Facebook friends of your target client. Many consumers avoid your company’s messages and adverts because they find them bothersome, especially when they want to communicate with friends. <br>
													
													On the other hand, a business website guarantees that you have the interest of a possible customer. Therefore, the likelihood of them making a purchase is higher once they are on your website, even though you may have to 
													put in some more effort to get them there. <br>
													
													We're not in any way implying that your business does not need a Facebook page, rather your Facebook page and other social media platforms should complement your website rather than take its place. 
												</li>

											</ol> 

												<h3>Importance of Having a Website</h3>

												Your credibility, visibility, and lead generation all improve when you have a website. You are completely free 
												to design it however you want and to promote whatever you want because it is your property. It's a perfect spot to 
												showcase positive comments and respond to any inquiries potential consumers might have. <br>

												Gains from a Website: <br>
												There are several benefits to having a business website, regardless of how big or small your business is. The following are the main advantages of having a website.
												
												<h5>1.	You look professional if you have a business website </h5>
													On Facebook, anyone can easily and for no cost build a business profile. A corporate social media profile loses
													 a lot of credibility due to this low entrance barrier. Customers have no idea who or where is operating a Facebook 
													 profile or whether everything is a fraud. <br> 

													However, building a website for your business is not free and shows that you take your enterprise seriously. Consequently, 
													having a business website enhances your credibility and professionalism.
													
									

												<h5>2.	It's a crucial stage in your customer journey</h5>
													You want potential customers from several social channels to land on your website. Your website is where you can motivate potential customers to take action. 

													People browse your website like they would a real store before entering to see what you have to offer. Therefore, even if they don't buy anything the first time they enter, they could do so later.
													
													In a similar vein, potential customers find your company through various sources including social media feeds. If the social feed advertisement piques their curiosity, they'll anticipate visiting your website to learn more about the company. They might not go to the next logical step in the customer journey if there is no website. 
													
												

												<h5>3.	Having a website makes you more visible </h5>
														Over 4.5 billion people use the internet on a daily basis, 
														and more than 90% of them do so using mobile devices.
														Your company is essentially invisible to these customers without a website. 
														If you don't invest in a website, your company will lose visibility to those who matter as 
														COVID-19 has driven the global market even more digital
												
												

												<h5>4.	Small businesses in your community need it. </h5>
												Many small business owners do not recognize the necessity of making an investment in a successful company website. And so they're giving up a fantastic source of income.

												The numbers below demonstrate how crucial a website is for a local business: 
												
												46% of Google searches have local intent. <br> 
												97% of people turn to search to locate nearby businesses. <br>
												In response to a local search, 28% of users make a purchase. <br>
												70% of consumers will visit a shop as a result of their internet research, you may realize all of this potential and increase the profitability of your business by creating a website.
												
												
												<h5>5.	It provides social evidence </h5>
												Whether you receive business depends on what your consumers have to say about you. Therefore, even while review sites are useful, the best location for customers to learn more about your company is on your website. 

												To build trust and social evidence, showcase your greatest customer reviews on your website. Additionally, by posting your finest customer testimonials on your website, you may prevent negative comments about your company on independent review websites.
												
												<h5>6.	A company website provides long-term value </h5>
												One of the nicest things about making an investment in a business website is how it keeps paying off for you years after you first built it. 

												Potential customers only see your adverts for as long as you are running them when you purchase social media advertising. You'll have to pay again to conduct the advertising campaign if they don't notice it. 
												
												A company website, on the other hand, will provide you with ROI over time. If it doesn't yield returns in the first year, you still have time to make adjustments until you do.
												
												<h5>7.	It's less expensive and easier than you think to build a business website </h5>
												Due to their perception that it is difficult and very expensive to establish an effective website, many business owners choose not to do so. But that's not accurate. 

												There has never been a more cost-effective or convenient moment to build a high-quality website. You can find inexpensive website builders that are simple to use. The process of building and hosting a website is rather simple.
												
												<h5>8.	An E-commerce website allows you to sell your goods and services. </h5>
												It is projected that e-commerce sales will increase rapidly and are expected to surpass $5.4 trillion in 2023. For certainty, none of these sales occurs for companies without websites. 

												Having an online shop may help you draw in new clients and enable you to continue selling even when your physical store is closed, even if your company isn't a conventional e-commerce one.
												<h5>9.	You have absolute control over your website. </h5>
												In contrast to social networking sites, your website is your property, giving you unlimited creative freedom. 

												Post whatever you like, including user comments, videos, photographs, and other media. 
												
												Additionally, you are not compelled to follow the regularly modified policies of the social networking networks. If there is a social media blackout, like the prolonged outage of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, your website and its content are also preserved.
												<h5>10.	Maintaining a business website is easy </h5>
												Managing websites used to be challenging. However, content management systems (CMS) like CMS Hub or WordPress have made website administration simpler than ever. You may also update your website without having any technological expertise.

												<h5>11.	Enhancing customer service using online resources </h5>
												A top-notch website will provide plenty of important information for your customers. They don't need to get in touch to find out the address, the opening hours, or any other simple questions. By helping users, a website improves the whole customer experience. 

												Simple customer queries don't divert your personnel, which allows them to focus on other important duties that increase productivity at work.
												
												<h5>12.	Having a website gives you a competitive advantage.</h5>
												Even as a small business, having a good website gives you the ability to compete with the "big boys" in your industry. If you play your cards well and optimize your website, you could outrank bigger websites and get high-quality leads organically from search engines. <br>

												In the end, it's up to you whether or not to build a website for your company. Making a website is a great place to start if one of your business objectives is to generate leads and increase exposure, social proof, and authority.

								<h2 class="card-title">What You Need To Know About How Social Media Impacts Consumer Behaviour</h2>
								<p class="card-text"> Have you ever stopped to think about how social media might affect consumer behaviour? The truth is that social media has changed 
									the way we interact with other people, with friends and family and also with businesses.</p>
									<div id="video-description">
										<p> <h6>What is Consumer buying behaviour?</h6> 
											The decisions and behaviours people exhibit when they purchase and utilize a product are referred to as consumer buying behaviour. The end customer's purchasing patterns are those of the consumer. Businesses need to evaluate and change their anticipated future buying trends.
											In order to enable consumer purchases of what, where, when, and how, businesses must develop a marketing mix (MM) that will appeal to (use) their customers, according to this marketing philosophy. A company's product and success are heavily determined by how customers respond to its marketing technique. 
											Marketers can more readily forecast how customers will react to marketing initiatives, so you need to examine what you're doing.
											
											Everybody has had the sensation of entering a store and finding something they really must have. Every year, retailers spend billions for adverts on the web, video and print advertisements, social media efforts, and branding in an effort to evoke that emotion in their customers. What then motivates that behaviour? And how can you record that "lightning in a bottle" moment when a prospect becomes a client and then reproduce it? This blog will explore the many sorts of purchasers as well as the factors that affect and shape consumer purchasing behaviour.
											
										</p>
										<div id="video-description-more" style="display: none;">
										  <p>Consumer buying behavior describes the steps people take before making a purchase of goods and services, both online and offline. Search engine research, participation in social media discussions, and a range of other activities might be part of this process. Understanding this process is beneficial for businesses because it enables them to better match their marketing attempts to those that have previously been effective in persuading customers to make purchases.</p>
											
										 <h5>Consumer Buying Process Stages</h5>
												The Six Stages are as follows:
										  <ol><li><h6>Problem Recognition/Need</h6>
											In the initial phase of the process, consumers truly attempt to distinguish between the desired state and the actual condition. They question if the things are actually needed. 
											</li>
											<li><h6>Informational Research </h6>
												The consumer search process starts after an issue is identified. They are seeking a remedy because they are aware that there is a problem. 
												<ul>• Introspection: They think back on their previous contacts. </ul>
												<ul>• External search: They ask their friends and family if they need more information. aggressively advertised online resources, public forums, comparison shopping, etc. 
													A buyer is presented with prospective alternatives, or the evoked set, following a successful information search.
													</ul>
											</li>
											<li><h6>Looking for Alternatives </h6>
												Customers look for alternatives to help them evaluate things because they want to. Kids may experience this, learn what they want and don't want, and learn what to anticipate. Price and rank/weight alternatives are employed as search stimuli. Businesses can affect this through the commercial marketing of alternatives and consumer research.
											</li>

											<li><h6>Deciding to buy</h6>
												After carefully weighing all pertinent factors, including quality, price, packing, service, etc.
											</li>
											
											<li><h6>Purchase</h6>
												Even though it could appear that this is the final step, a sudden shift in the situation, such as the availability of a better option or external pressure, may nevertheless lead to the choice to be modified at that same time. 
											</li>
											<li><h6>Post-Purchase Evaluation/Cognitive Dissonance </h6>
												As a result of poor service, customers may become depressed and start to regret their purchase. Businesses are in a difficult condition, but it may be improved by offering assistance through warranties, programs, and top-notch customer service. 
											</li>
											<h6>Social Media:</h6>
											Social media has changed the way we communicate, shop, and conduct a number of other business activities. Over time, it also has had a significant impact on consumer behaviour. In fact, some studies suggest that social media influences people's decisions about brands and products more than any other form of marketing today.
											
											<h6>How Social Media Impact On Consumer Behavior:</h6>
											<ul>1.	Customers increasingly make direct purchases on social media platforms.</ul>
											Social networking is almost as popular for discovering new products as radio and TV commercials, as well as word-of-mouth advertising. In the future, this is how three out of ten consumers stated they would want to learn about brands. However, customers are using social media more and more to research businesses and make purchases from them.

											<ul>2.	Social media reviews have a significant impact on consumer behaviour.</ul>
											A dynamic source of social evidence, which is a crucial factor to take into account while making purchases, is social media. 51% of consumers examine reviews on forums or social media before making a purchase to evaluate a good or service. Just one or two unfavourable reviews might put off a potential customer.
											
											<h6>Customers anticipate two-way communication with brands.</h6>
											Social media has given the relationship between a company and its customers a new dimension. It is no longer a case where the brand is distanced from the potential customer. You may assess a brand's values, current news, goods and services, and relationship with its target market by analyzing its network.

											<h6>For customer assistance, consumers use social media.</h6>
											Before social media, how did you envision interacting with a brand's customer support department? You can reach them by phoning, writing, going to meet them in person, visiting, etc. Nowadays, customers choose to contact businesses on social media to voice their complaints or concerns about their services.
